# Quadris

A Tetris like 2D game

Implemented in C++. Originally it had 2 modes(graphical and text as shown in the pictures), also the game is non-real, blocks would only move when user input different instructions.

However, i recently partially re-implement only graphical mode of this game which becomes real-time for showcase purpose. I used SDL2 libraries to draw graphics and handle user input.
