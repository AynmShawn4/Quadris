# Quadris

A Tetris like 2D game implemented in C++.

Originally it had 2 modes(graphical and text as shown in the pictures), also the game is not real-time, blocks would only move when user input different instructions.

Recently, i partially re-implement graphical mode of this game for showcase purpose. I used SDL2 libraries to draw graphics and handle user input.
